# Spring Boot Task Management Application
A task manager app created with spring boot to improve my skills  
  
PostgreSQL was used to store the users and tasks  
  
BCrypt was used to encode the passwords  
  
Signup page checks for username and email uniqueness from the database, compares the password fields if they are equal and checks if the email is correctly written or not with regex  
  
After they sign up or login, they can add, edit and delete tasks
